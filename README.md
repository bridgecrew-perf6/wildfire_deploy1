# Final_Project_Wildfires Deploy Repo
This repository is associatied with the "Final_Project_Wildfires" repository for Team k.E.G.d.  
 - *https://github.com/goatgirl86/Final_Project_Wildfires.git*

## Purpose
By adding ONLY the web application files for Team k.E.G.d.'s Web App (and not include the other coding files) in this repository, we are able to make our web app smaller and easier for deployment on Heroku.

Our Heruko app can be viewed at *https://salty-depths-05618.herokuapp.com/*

## Note
This above web app was created in May 2022 as part of a Final Project for the University of Denver's Data Analytics BootCamp (a Trilogy Education Services program). *It is NOT intended to provide real life predictions.*

**We thank our instructor, Svitlana, and our T.A.s, James, Sheri, and Simon, for all their assistance on this project.**
